# Cookie Clicker

## Introduction

Welcome aboard, comrades. In this file, you will discover a project on which we worked in groups of three during a few days (4 to be precise). 
The goal of this challenge was to use JavaScript and test our skills by trying to reproduce a Cookie Cliker.

The inspiration we had for our cookie clicker was [this one - orteil cookie clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/).

## The Challenge

The goal was not to completely replicate the cookie clicker you just saw a second ago. It was to come up with our own concept and write all the necessary codes to make it work as well as the Orteil cookie clicker.

## Our Project

We wanted to change the concept and make it our own. Instead of a cookie-clicker we worked on a "Pokeball clicker". Everytime people click on the pokedall, they will get a Pokedollar which is needed in order to buy boosters, multipliers or auto-clickers. 

When reaching a certain amount of Pokeball, players will be able to buy multipliers that will multiply the number of Pokedollars they own for a certain price. 

Auto-clickers are pokemons that will click for player every second or so, helping them collect as much Pokedollar possible without them clicking.

Boosters are temporaly boost that give an increased amount of Pokedollar while clicking. It last for 30 secondes.

Just for your information, we used **Bootstrap** framework for the front-end.

### Features

Here are the feature asked to implement :

- A place to **display the score**
- A button to **increase the score** when people click on it.
- A **multiplier** button that will multiply the number of points per click.
- A **price of multiplier** : Nothing is free, you have to earn it as well.
- **No negative score** : This means you can't buy something if you don't have enough credit.
- A **multiplier counter** showing your multiplier score.
- **Cost increasing** : Want to buy more? Then you will have to pay more each time.
- **Cost displayer** : Players need to see how much money it takes to get something.
- **Auto-clicker** options : Players can pay to receive auto-clicks automatically.
- **Bonus** : To make the game even better, some bonuses are available and give a boost to the score for a limited time.
- **Deactivated buttons** : If the player does not have enough credit, he/she should not be able to click the buttons.
- **Pretty design** : As you may know, everything is better when it looks nice... So we tried to make our game nice to look at.
